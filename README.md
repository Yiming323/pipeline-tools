Machine learning algorithm selection tool for pipeline condition assessment

# Introduction
There are many types of nondestructive testing data, pre-processing algorithms, feature extraction methods, and machine learning models used for pipeline condition assessment when using machine learning methods to detect, classify, locate and quantify one or more types of anomalies, including functional anomalies and structural defects. Choosing the appropriate algorithm is difficult. This website provides an online algorithm recommendation tool based on your needs.
